Project Overview

This project implements Logistic Regression to analyze a Social Advertisements dataset. The goal is to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on given features such as age, estimated salary, and other demographic details. The project also includes a Streamlit-based web application for interactive visualization and prediction.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

Streamlit (Web Application)

Dataset

The dataset consists of user demographic information and whether they purchased a product or not. The key features include:

Age

Estimated Salary

Purchased (Target variable: 0 or 1)

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and dataset splitting.

Model Training: Implements Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn.

Visualization: Displays data distributions and model performance.

Web Interface: Uses Streamlit to provide an interactive UI for predictions.

Usage

Upload or load the dataset.

Train the Logistic Regression model.

Enter user details for prediction.

View results and probability scores.

Future Improvements

Add hyperparameter tuning.

Implement other classification models for comparison.

Enhance UI with additional visualizations.
